## Base information
## This information should only be modified once. This holds base information for your mod that SHOULDN'T be changed!

# This is the namespace of your mod. Theoretically, you should own this domain,
# However you may use io.github.yourusernamehere if you like. (Don't use com.github)
GROUP=com.example

# This is ideally your mod id. Combined with GROUP, creates the full namespace of your mod,
# and you should put all your mod files under this directory.  
ARTIFACT=examplemod

# This is your mod id, duh! Should be the same as ARTIFACT
MOD_ID=examplemod

# Determines the prefix for your compiled jar files: {ARCHIVES_BASE_NAME}-{MINECRAFT_VERSION}-{VERSION}.jar
# You can change the behaviour of this in your build.gradle variable "archivesBaseName"
# This can actually be changed without any consequences.
